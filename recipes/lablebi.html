        <h2>What is lablebi?</h2>
        <p>Lablebi is traditionally served quite simply, as it's a dish meant to provide sustenance for cold days, using frugal ingredients. Chickpeas and their spiced broth provide a hearty dose of protein and stale bread is brought back to life in the liquid.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole, dry chickpeas.</li>
            <li>3 ½ -4 cups water.</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin.</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt.</li>
            <li>½ tsp black pepper.</li>
            <li>2 whole eggs poached.</li>
            <li>Canned tuna.</li>
            <li>Harissa and/or crushed red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Olive oil.</li>
            <li>Stale bread or fresh kesra turn into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Accompaniments: Tuna, Olives, Egg, Harissa, Capers, Pickled vegetable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chickpeas in a large bowl and add water. Allow the chickpeas to soak overnight. Make sure chickpeas are fully covered by the water.</li>
            <li>For the chickpeas and the water they soaked in into a pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, partially cover and allow to simmer until very tender. Skim any foam that may develop at the surface.</li>
            <li>Once the chickpeas are fully cooked, add the salt, pepper, and cumin. Stir and remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Serve hot in a bowl and add your preferred garnish. You can go simple and traditional with just pepper flakes and a drizzle of olive oil. Or go all out and add the stale bread to soak up the broth, a generous spoonful of harissa, some good quality Tunisian tuna, and a poached egg to top it all off.</li>
        </ol>
